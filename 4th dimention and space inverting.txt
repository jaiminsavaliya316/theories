-- Things below are my hypothesis
# Earth is maybe not round and not flat either.
- Imagine a person A who lives in 3D but can only perceive 2d. Imagine him moving flat in 3D (XY plane) now add a 3D object like sphere. When A moves over this sphere he can not see it's 3d he will see it as 2d so he would think that this thing is expanding (he would perceive sphere as maybe 1 X 2r thing but when he starts walking on it he would be travelling 2 X pi X r). Similar is happening with out universe, where we are thinking that it's expanding but maybe there is a possibility that we are moving in 4d space but can not perceive it and it looks to us as if universe is expanding. 

Q Then why when I circle around earth it does feel like it's expanding.
A Because earth is small to observe the anomality. Dimensional animalities are subjective to dimension we can perceive. person who can see 1D will think that line is abnormal because it imitates that 1D spaces are stacked, but 2D perceiving person would say 'Meh, it's just a line'. When we stack lines to create 3D, 2d person will find it abnormal but that 3D object to 3D perceiving person would be so normal. Similarly earth is too small for us to observe dimensional abnormalities. We have to look universe as one entity to see anomality. 

Q Well universe is just bigger in size, we are not stacking 3D universe.
A Well maybe space is not as we think it is. It might be stacked but because we can't see 4D, we think it's big 3D.



# Space is not expanding it's actually expanding and inverting at same time.
+ We will need too much imagination to understand. 
- Imagine a rubber tube/pipe now put your fingers inside of it and thumbs outside. Now twist you hands such a way that your thumbs are reshaping pipe and now thumbs are inside pipe and fingers are outside of the pipe. I call this inverting, and our space is also imitating same. I do not mean it's in a shape of tube/pipe. I mean it's in a weird shape (weird because we can not perceive it) and it's inverting. Space feels like expanding as inner side of tube/pipe but gravity brings things closer and here space works as outer side of tube. Space is in a shape where it is continuously expanding and inverting. Maybe it's not a single entity. it composes of multiples that's why black hole exist.

- Maybe black hole is just torn space while trying to invert and we can not perceive the shape it's torn, because we can only see 3D.
- Maybe black hole is the state after completer inversion. After the inversion it's shape is so weird and not sphere because we can not perceive 4D object and currently see it as a sphere Like mentioned above. Transition from star to black hole maybe can be seen from 4th dimension but because we can only see 3D. it looks that one sphere (star) is converted into another sphere (blackhole).
